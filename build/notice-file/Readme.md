# Notice.txt File Configuration

We are automatically generating Notice.txt by using first-level dependencies of the project. The related pipeline uses `config.yaml` stored in this folder.


## Configuration

Notice.txt will be always generated from first-level dependencies scanned from package.json files. For some cases it may be useful to define the
dependency to add its licence to the Notice.txt even if it is not first-level dependency or development dependency.

For instance at desktop project we need to add `wix`'s licence to the Notice.txt even if it is not a first-level dependency. To do that, define
all dependencies at `dependencies` array at the configuration. For any dependency at `dependencies` section, pipeline code will add their 
licenses to the Notice.txt file.

At webapp project `webpack` used in `devDependencies`, it is requested because we are using some files generated by `webpack`. If any dependency is
referenced at `devDependencies` section, pipeline will add those dependency licences when they are referenced at `package.json` files.

Sample:

```

search:
  - "package.json"
dependencies:
  - "wix"
devDependencies: 
  - "webpack"
```
